      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/add9fc-9cd89c-f6d3f4-eae1c2-ba91d1" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/add9fc-9cd89c-f6d3f4-eae1c2-ba91d1</a>

        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Pacifico, Sacramento, Arial   <!-- change this -->

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Fresca, Roboto, Arial  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <h3>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h3>
      <p>
        I chose the Pacifico font for the heading because I wanted to link the text from the logo to the rest of the website. I added Sacramento because it closely resembels the previous fonts. If the browser can't read the first two fonts I have Arial as my last resort because it can be read by every browser.
        For my paragraph fonts I chose Fresca as my maine font because it is a little fun but still very readable. A Website about cotton candy needs to be fun! I have Roboto and Arial as backup fonts.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h3>
      <p class="colored">
        As a site for cotton candy, I wanted to use colors that would remind the user of cotton candy and give a fun happy feeling. The colors I choose were taken from a image of candies, then with the help of my son, taylored till the colors reminded him of cotton candy. My hope is to have a fun cheerful website were people can learn more about the Cotton Candy Brothers and their product.<br><br>Just had a thought that maybe I'll change the colors the better match the colors in the logo. Brighter colors and not so pastel. Maybe...
