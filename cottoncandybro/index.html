                <p>A little about us!
        
                    Alma and Otto, are two brothers with a vision. Alma's entrepreneurial spirit pushes him to make an enterprise with almost anything. Have you ever had a movie night at your home? Have you ever had to pay for your treats? Alma is all over that. Otto, the candy connoisseur, enjoys his candy more than anyone we know. When he was seven he asked for a cotton candy machine for Christmas, not a toy one but a real one. Also being business-minded and good with his money he joined forces with Alma to conquer a new adventure.
