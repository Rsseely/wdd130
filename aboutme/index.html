    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="images/Ryan.jpg" alt="Image of me" style="width:128px;height:152px;">
    <h2>Hi, I'm Ryan.</h2>
        <p>I am working towards achieving my certificate in Web and Computer Programming. I have always shied from doing things like this because of all the reading. I am pretty sure I'm dyslexic and ADHD, so I'll be slow at reading and get distracted more than once.</p>
        <p>I have a great family! A beautiful wife and two cute little boys.</p>
        <p>I am learing web design with the hope that I will be able to work remotely or for myself online. I use to run my own business until I sold it and moved to where I live now, a small town called Magrath. Here I have been working a the Production Manager for a company called Inline Ovals. We manufacture and sell oval and round picture frames and mirrors. We do othe shapes as well. Being in a job is not for me, I need more flexibility and control over what I can do.</p>
        <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints all my life. My current calling are pretty good, I'm one of the Primary Activity Day leaders and the Ward gamer! I joke, it's really the ward technology specialist; I help broadcast our sacrement meetings to those stuck at home.</p>
